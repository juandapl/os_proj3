# Readers and Writers (CS-UH 3010 Project 3)
### Created by Juan Pi√±eros and Nicholas Raffone

#### The coordinator, reader, writer, and monitor programs enables the user to coordinate, reader, write, and monitor the status of the students' grades.

## Usage

### Compilation
Run the command `make` to assemble all files

### Running the programs

#### Coordinator
Run `./coordinator` to start the program. The shared memory id will be generated and can be used for the other programs. On termination, it will delete the shared memory data and output statistics.

#### Writer
Run `./writer -f {binary_filepath} -l {record_id} -d {delay_in_s} -s {shared_mem_id}` to run the writer. It will modify the file and describe its usage statistics.

#### Reader
Run `./writer -f {binary_filepath} -l {record_id[,record_id...]} -d {delay_in_s} -s {shared_mem_id}` to run the reader. It will read from the file and describe its usage statistics.

#### Monitor
Run `./monitor -s {shared_mem_id}` to run the monitor. Keep this running to see real-time updates across all processes.

### Removing files
Run the command `make clean` to delete all files

## Design Choices

The overall structure of the programs is the coordinator initializing the shared memory, the readers and writers doing their operations with respect to the critical section problem, and the monitor who constantly checks the state of the shared memory. The data is logged to log.txt while the readers and writers execute.

Upon invoking a reader/writer, the process checks whether or not it is able to enter the waiting queue for its process type. This is determined by whether or not there are conflicting processes that already exists in the waiting queue. Once done, the process is free to continue. Once done, it sets its flags in the waiting queue to indicate completion, and exits as it describe its usage statistics.

### General Structures
In order to implement this system with a limited number of semaphores, we chose to implement arrays of `WriteHeads` and `Readers`, which implement locations from which processes are authorized to access the binary data file.

#### WriteHeads (10 by default)
A WriteHead contains information about an active writing process, the segment it is working with, and a semaphore that can pause reader processes that want to access the same segment. The WriteHead also contains the number of such waiting processes.

Writers use a ticketing system to get access to the WriteHeads if full. However, if a WriteHead is currently busy with an incoming writer's desired segment, the incoming process will wait until the conflicting writer is finished. Similarly, readers will queue behind the WriteHead's `proc_queue` semaphore if the WriteHead is currently writing to their desired segment. On exit, a writer will wake up all waiting readers using the necessary amount of `sem_post` calls.

#### Readers (100 by default)
Readers contain information about an active reading process and the segment it is working with. Similarly, Reader processes use a ticketing system to access these reading slots. Before accessing a segment, writers will check if there are any readers currently reading from the segment. If there are, the writer will wait until there are no readers reading from it.

### Semaphores

Critical Section Mutex: Only 1 process at a time should be able to access the critical section. This is done by the critical section mutex semaphore.

Log Mutex: To prevent overwriting other processes' log messages, a log mutex is set in place so that only 1 process is writing to the logfile at the same time.

WriteHead Queue: In the special case where a writer is currently writing to segment i and a reader wants to read segment i, the reader must wait for the writer to complete its operation. The writehead queue exists for each writer in the WriteHeads, and if this were situation were to occur, the reader will have to wait for this semaphore to increment before reading the desired segment.


### Critical Section Problem

#### Mutual Exclusion

Mutual Exclusion is satisfied by the cs_mutex, where all critical sections are only run if and only if they have the cs_mutex. This can only occur for one process at a time as all others get locked out.

In terms of the reader/writer problem, mutual exclusion is satisfied by the fact that writers will be transferred to the writehead queue if a writer is currently writing to their desired segment, and that readers will queue behind a writehead's `proc_queue` semaphore if said writehead is currently writing to their desired segment.

#### Progress

The progress requirement is satisfied because the decision to enter the critical section relies on the processes who wish to enter the critical section. Once a process has completed its read/write operation and updates its wait queue entry, it has no more bearing on which process will enter into the critical section next. In other words, it will not hold up any other processes, and so there will be progress made by the others.

#### Bounded Waiting
Bounded waiting is satisfied by the ticketing system. A process enters a line of other processes and the process with the lowest ticket number is permitted to enter the waiting queue. This means that a process will have to wait a definite amount of time before it is able to enter the waiting queue and then get called. 

As well, regarding readers that are queueing behind a writehead, the exiting writer process will wake up all waiting reader processes, and so the readers will not have to wait indefinitely.
